In this project I test the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to identify particles in the GlueX detector at Jefferson Laboratory. I train the multi-lyared percpetron (MLP) models on smeared monte carlo data that will be extrapolated on to real detector outputs.

Inside of the `charged_mlp.py` and `neutral_mlp.py` scripts the MLP models of the charged and neutral particles are trained and saved using Tensorflow. The classification of particles is then carried out in the `mlp_pid.py` script where arrays of the outputs of this anlysis are saved to the `paper_plots` folder. All figures from the manuscript can be recreated in the `paper_plots.ipynb` notebook. 

As for manual particle identification (PID), all analysis is carried out in the `manual_pid.py` script. This includes both dE/dx - p and timing cuts, both of which are optimized in this notebook with the optimal dE/dx - p cuts being saved to the `paper_plots` folder along with the manual PID results. Similarly, all plots can be recreated in the `paper_plots.ipynb` notebook.
